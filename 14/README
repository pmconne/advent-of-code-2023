establish an imaginary perimeter of #.
to tilt north, start at (0,0) and scan south until out of bounds
initial blockadePos = -1 unless we insert actual perimeter tiles.
	# => blockadePos = cur
	. => nothing
	O => if blockadePos + 1 < cur:
		*cur = .; *blockadePos++ = O

Part 2:

Seems like it ought to get caught in a loop pretty quickly.
Have to detect when it does.
Store a record of the configuration after each spin cycle. Just stringify the grid.
