# = damaged
. = operational
? = # | .
Followed by list of the number of # in each group
Groups of # are always separated by at least one .

I guess whenever you hit a ? you must branch and evaluate all possible sub-solutions from that position to end.
	i.e., evaluate for . and for #.
Could brute-force by simply producing an exhaustive list of all possible combinations, then count how many satisfy the criterion.
Might be too slow...try it on the sample input.
