There are 13 different card values: 2-9 and TJQKA
The initial order matters for breaking ties if both hands have the same type (full house, two pair, etc).

A hand's STRENGTH is determined by its type.
A hand's RANK is its position in a list of all hands sorted by strength.

First produce one list of hands for each type.
Then sort each list.
Then concatenate them.
Now you have ranks.


Sorting within a type could just be a lexical sort if we replace the card symbols.
  T=A J=B Q=C K=D A=E

Determining type:
  Sort the five characters in hand
  Count top two max contiguous number of same character.
L
