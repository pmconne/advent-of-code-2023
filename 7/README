There are 13 different card values: 2-9 and TJQKA
The initial order matters for breaking ties if both hands have the same type (full house, two pair, etc).

A hand's STRENGTH is determined by its type.
A hand's RANK is its position in a list of all hands sorted by strength.

First produce one list of hands for each type.
Then sort each list.
Then concatenate them.
Now you have ranks.


Sorting within a type could just be a lexical sort if we replace the card symbols.
  T=A J=B Q=C K=D A=E

Determining type:
  Sort the five characters in hand
  Count top two max contiguous number of same character.

--- Part 2

How hands can be improved by jokers?
Count the number of jokers then remove them, then categorize the remaining hand.
  5 OAK => 5 OAK (max 0 J) subtract nJokers
  4 OAK => 5 OAK (max 1 J) subtract nJokers
  FH (max 0 J) subtract nJokers
    1 => 4 OAK
    2 => 5 OAK
  3 OAK (max 2 J) subtract nJokers + 1
    1 => 4 OAK
    2 => 5 OAK
  2 pair (max 1 J) subtract nJokers + 1
    1 => FH
    2 => 4 OAK
    3 => 5 OAK
  1 pair (max 3 J) 
    1 => 3 OAK (5 => 3)
    2 => 4 OAK (5 => 
    3 => 5 OAK
  0 pair (max 5 J)
    1 => 1 pair
    2 => 3 OAK
    3 => 4 OAK
    4 => 5 OAK
    5 => 5 OAK


What about hands containing all jokers, or 4, or 3?
