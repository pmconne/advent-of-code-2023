Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green

Split on : => Game ###, rest
  Split Game ### on ' ' => [1] = game ID
  Split rest on ;
    Split each on ,
      Split each on ' '
        parse [0] as count and [1] as color
          max[color] = max(max[color], count)

Part 2:
Just find the maximum of each color for each game, that's the minimum of each color required for all games.
No game is missing a color.
