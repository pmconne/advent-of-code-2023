Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200

Each time-distance pair represents the current record for one race. You want to beat each record.
Hold button for N ms, travel at N mm/ms

Race 1: hold for 2-5 to win.
Race 2: hold for 4-11 to win.
Race 3: hold for 11-19 to win.

Given T - the fixed length of the race in ms and N the variable number of seconds to hold the button, compute D the distance you will travel.
D = N*(T-N)

Each race = { T time, R record distance }.
We need D to be > the record R.

N*(T-N) > R
N > R/(T-N)
N > R/T - R/N
N > R(1/T - 1/N)
um.

We know we must travel at least R + 1 mm to win.
G = R+1
N*(T-N) > G will tell you the minimum, right?

Race 1: T=7 R=9. Start at 1, find first result > R.
1*6 = 6
2*5 = 10

To compute the maximum time we can hold:
Continue to T, stop once we find first result < R
