WF = name{cond1:action1,cond2:action2,...,defaultAction}
The starting workflow is named "in"
Action can be A)ccept, R)eject, or the name of the next workflow.

Part 2
Could work backwards from A states. Do rules form a tree or a graph?
	Looks like you can't reach the same rule via multiple paths.
Parse each rule as a { prop, min, max, result }

Working backwards from "A" means counting some combos more than once.
