Given node index I find shortest path to each node with index > I.
No obstructions in grid. Movement only up down left or right.
Shortest path should be easy to find: at each step find delta x and delta y, move in the direction of the largest |delta|.

Part 2

Sounds like they want weights applied to each tile - i.e., any tile in a completely empty column/row has a weight of 1,000,000.
Probably supposed to use Dijstrka.
Except, if we can only move in 4 directions then the shortest path is always the same length whether you go all the way along one axis then along the other,
or stair-step along a diagonal.
So path-finding shouldn't be needed - shortest distance is just delta x + delta y.

Could add 1m to each galaxy coordinate for each empty row/column preceding it.
Then existing algo would work (but slow...)
Maybe just add the extra distances for empty rows/columns when computing shortest path.
