Flood fill again?
Size of grid unknown at start? Could be determined by adding up all LR and UD movement.
Brute-force part 1. Presumably the RGB values will be relevant in part 2.

Puzzle input produces a map where the dug path never criss-crosses itself.
Also the dug path always has at least one undug tile between it.
So simple scan should work

Part 2
Yeah flood-filling a grid's not gonna work this time.
Need area of a polygon (non-convex).
