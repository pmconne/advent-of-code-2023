Every pipe in the loop connects to exactly two neighbors.
So tile S has exactly two pipes in the 4 cardinal directions, which must be part of the loop.
Just follow both of those connections until they converge on the same tile.

To follow the path through a tile you need to know from which direction you entered it.
Actually probably just need to follow one connection until you return to the start, then chop the the distance in half.
We know the tile we're on and the direction we want to move.
Add 1 to distance.
Get coords of tile in desired direction.
Get tile at those coords. If S => done.
Else determine exit direction based on tile and entrance direction and repeat.
