Enters from northwest, traveling west.
Continues until it exits the boundaries of the grid.
Assuming no loops (beams all eventually exit)?

Nope there are cycles.
Record on each hot tile the directions from which we previously entered it, don't re-enter from same direction.

Part 2
Could brute force it and cache on each tile the number of tiles that get energized when entering from a given direction.
